This directory contains unit tests for the Storage Manager, using the standard Python unit tests framework (unittest). The file structure is very tentative.

To add a new unit test, have a look at vdi_tests.py. Also, you MUST add the new test case in rununittests.py.

The build target "smunittests.tar" is currently unused, it's a placeholder
for moving the unit tests out of the tests/ directory some time in the future.

To run a specific unit test:
./<test> <test params> <class>.<method>
E.g:
./vdi_tests.py <VM UUID> VDIBasicTest.test_attach_simultaneously
